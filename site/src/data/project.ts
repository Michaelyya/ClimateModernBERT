  blurb:
    "A family of climate-domain ModernBERT encoders. We continue-pretrain ModernBERT-Base on academic climate text, climate-filtered web data, and synthetic climate text, then ask which corpus composition — and which integration mechanism — actually helps.",
  abstract:
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the climate domain requires models to process heterogeneous text sources, including scientific literature, policy disclosures, and synthetic reports. However, how to effectively combine diverse domain corpora during continued pretraining (CPT) remains underexplored. We introduce Climate-ModernBERT, a family of climate-adapted encoder models obtained through continued pretraining of ModernBERT-Base on three climate corpora: academic climate text, climate-filtered web data, and synthetic climate documents. We systematically compare joint continued pretraining on corpus mixtures with parameter-space merging of independently specialized checkpoints. Across nine climate NLP benchmarks, our best model achieves 76.3 average F1, improving significantly over a vanilla ModernBERT baseline by 2.8 points. Within the climate NLP setting, the results show that academic climate corpora provide the strongest adaptation signal among the evaluated sources, while parameter-space merging improves over joint multi-source training and better preserves complementary information from heterogeneous climate corpora. We release all Climate-ModernBERT variants and training checkpoints to support future research in climate NLP and domain-adaptive pretraining.",
